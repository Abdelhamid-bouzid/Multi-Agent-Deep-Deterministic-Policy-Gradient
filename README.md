Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

This is a pytorch implemntation of the paper entitled "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed
Cooperative-Competitive Environments" ("https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf").

You will need to install the Multi Agent Particle Environment(MAPE), which you can find here: https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs


# All the Credit to Phil Tabor
This code is based on the implementation of Phil Tabor, Please check his GitHub "https://github.com/philtabor" and his youtube channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58v9cLitc8VaCjrcKyAbrw", he has well orgized and explained codes of most of the RL key papers.
